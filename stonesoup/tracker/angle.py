class AngleSingleTargetTracker(SingleTargetTracker):
    """A simple angle-only single target tracker.

    Track a single object using Stone Soup components in platform-centric
    polar angles, elevation and azimuth, and optionally range. It is important to note that the
    state vector is assumed to take the form of
        .. math::
            \mathbf{x}_{k} = \begin{bmatrix}\theta\\\dot{\theta}\\\varphi\\\dot{\varphi}\end{bmatrix}
    or
    .. math::
            \mathbf{x}_{k} = \begin{bmatrix}\theta\\\dot{\theta}\\\varphi\\\dot{\varphi}\\r\\\dot{r}\end{bmatrix}

    where :math:`\theta` is the elevation, :math:`\varphi` is the bearing, :math:`r` is the range to the
    object and the dot notation is used to define the rate of change of the parameters.
    The Angle-Only tracker works the same way as
    its Cartesian counterpart by first calling the :attr:`data_associator`
    with the active track, and then either updating the track state with
    the result of the :attr:`updater` if a detection is associated, or with
    the prediction if no detection is associated to the track. The difference is then the
    relevant state vector components are cast to :attr:`Elevation` and :attr:`Bearing` types.
    The track is checked for deletion by the :attr:`deleter`, and if deleted the
    :attr:`initiator` is called to generate a new track.
    Similarly, if no track is present (i.e. tracker is initialised
    or deleted in previous iteration), only the :attr:`initiator` is called.
